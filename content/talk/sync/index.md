summary: SYNC 2019
abstract: "This paper presents the reconstruction of Pama-Nyungan (Australia) verb conjugation classes using computational phylogenetic methods. Languages from a genealogically and geographically comprehensive sample (n=120) are labeled according to relevant morphological characters, including the presence or absence of verb conjugation classes, number of conjugation classes, and how membership is determined. This project demonstrates the viability of morphological characters in modern stochastic computational approaches to historical linguistics, including tree inference and ancestral state reconstruction."
