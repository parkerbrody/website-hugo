I am a PhD Candidate in the Yale University Department of Linguistics. My research interests include computational and mathematical methods for linguistic inquiry, historical linguistics, linguistic typology, and morphological theory. I am also interested in the application of modern computational tools for linguistic analysis to new domains of inquiry.
